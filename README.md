NOTE: Your path will be different to the one shown above. Remember to copy your path and not the one in the image above.

## Bulk Renaming ##
You need to have a new directory with the files you want to rename.
<br> WARNING: This program will rename EVERYTHING in the folder it is given. Remember to only put files you want renamed in the folder.

<br>
The software accepts 2 arguments. The first is the file path to the folder (mentioned above) and the second is the new name.

The command should be formatted like this:
> Renamr.exe [FILE PATH] [NEW NAME]
>
Where [FILE PATH] is the file path and [NEW NAME] is the name to rename the files to.

Here is what that looks like:

NOTE: Your path and new name will be different to the one shown above. Remember to copy your path and your new name and not the one in the image above.
