# Renamr #

A lightweight piece of software for renaming files in bulk from the command line.

## Installation ##
Install the software via the `Renamr-v2.0.2-Installer.msi` installer (located in the releases)

## Command Usage ##
The command should be used as follows:

```bash
Renamr [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY NEWNAME DELIMETER
```

The `DIRECTORY` is the folder which contains the files you wish to rename.

The `NEWNAME` is the name to remain the files to.

The `DELIMETER` is the seperator between the new name and number. For instance, if your new name is `Europe_Trip`, the file name would become for instance `Europe_Trip_1.txt`. The delimeter is the underscore in the above example.

## Further Options ##

Further options you can use are:

- `--skip-confirmation`: This option forgoes the usual confirmation to confirm the renaming operation.
- `--verbose`: This option prints each file, and it's new name to the standard output.
- `--help`: This option brings up the help page.

## Warnings ##

- ALL files inside the target folder WILL be renamed, and this cannot be undone. Please be careful to specify the correct target directory.

- Please do not use a delimeter which is used elswhere for something else in windows. For example, do not use a `.` as a delimeter, a file extension, or a special character like `ยง`. This may cause windows to do something unexpected, or even corrupt the file. `_` and `-` are great delimeters to use instead.
